# The Grafana-KDB Adaptor
Grafana is an open source analytics platform, used to display time-series data from a web application. Currently it supports a variety of data sources including Graphite, InfluxDb & Prometheus with users including the likes of Paypal, Ebay, Intel and Booking.com.  However, there is no in-built support for direct analysis of data from kdb+. Thus, using the SimpleJSON data source, we have engineered an adaptor to allow visualisation of kdb+ data.
